# CameraMan #

CameraMan is a Flash application for taking webcam photos from JavaScript, in
the spirit of SoundManager 2.


## Building CameraMan ##

To compile the CameraMan application, use the free (gratis) Adobe Flex 3 SDK:

    http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/
    http://opensource.adobe.com/flexsdk

With the SDK's `bin/mxmlc` on your path, use the included Makefile:

    make

Problems have been reported after building CameraMan with the Flex 4 SDK, so
make sure to use Flex 3.
